Taking a look at both the Gaussian and the SPP Elimination methods, they both have a time complexity of O(n^3).
However, the SPP Elimination method can have advantages if the systems coefficients have a large difference in magnitude.
After running each function, the Naive Gaussian took around 6,000 nanoseconds on average, while the SPP took about 30,000 nanoseconds.
This may be due to all the additional nested for loops that exist in the SPP function.
The double precision SPP function differed in results by 5.7 x 10^(-8) or .000000057 in the first value.
Therefore, the double precision a bit more precise, which the percent of error being .000026%.
There was a similar difference in precision in the single and double precision methods of the Naive Gaussian method.
Between the Naive and SPP methods, there was an even smaller error of about 1.81 x 10^(-11).
