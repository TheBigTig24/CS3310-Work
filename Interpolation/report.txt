While observing Newton's Interpolation function in code, we can estimate that for n inputs, the function will have a Big O of n.

After testing inputs of n amounts various times and plotting a line of best fit, the line of best fit showed a linear regression.
This shows that the function does indeed have a time complexity of n. No matter what point is to be evaluated, Newton's takes the same amount of time.
